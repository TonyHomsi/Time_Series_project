    "In recent years, anomaly detection has become more popular in the machine learning community. Despite this, there are definitely fewer resources on anomaly detection than classical machine learning algorithms. As such, learning about anomaly detection can feel more tricky than it should be. Anomaly detection is from a conceptual standpoint actually very simple!\n",

Specifically, I will show you how to implement anomaly detection in Python with the package PyOD — Python Outlier Detection. In this way, you will not only get an understanding of what anomaly/outlier detection is but also how to implement anomaly detection in Python.\n",

    "# 2 — What is Anomaly/Outlier Detection?\n",
    "Anomaly detection goes under many names; outlier detection, outlier analysis, anomaly analysis, and novelty detection. A concise description from Wikipedia describes anomaly detection as follows:\n",
    "Anomaly detection is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.\n",
    "Let‘s try to unpack the above statements. Say you have a dataset consisting of many observations. The goal of anomaly detection is to identify the observations that differ significantly from the rest. Why would you want to do this? There are two major reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case 1 — Data Cleaning\n",
    "When cleaning the data, it is sometimes better to remove anomalies as they misrepresent the data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anomaly detection is implementing algorithms to detect outliers automatically.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case 2 — Prediction\n",
    "In other applications, the anomalies themselves are the point of interest. Examples are network intrusion, bank fraud, and certain structural defects. In these applications, the anomalies represent something that is worthy of further study.\n",
    "* Network intrusion — anomalies in network data can indicate that a network attack of some sort has taken place.\n",
    "* Bank fraud — anomalies in transaction data can indicate fraud or suspicious behaviour.\n",
    "* Structural defects — anomalies can indicate that something is wrong with your hardware. While more traditional monitoring software is typically available in this setting, anomaly detection can discover more weird defects."
